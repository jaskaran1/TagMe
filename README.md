TagMe
======
TagMe! is a machine learning programming contest with the objective being to design algorithms for tagging/classifying a collection of images. Given a collection of images, you need to build a system that can categorize them into one of five categories: 'Human Faces', 'Flowers', 'Buildings', 'Cars', or 'Shoes'. Your system will be evaluated based on its accuracy. This is a multi-class classification supervised learning problem, where you will have a training set consisting of images and category labels and your system has to predict the labels correctly.
Got an accuracy of 68.4% on the test set.

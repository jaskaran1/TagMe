-------------------------------------------------


1> (*) :  Sections marked (*) are optional . Explain ony if you have explicitly used these steps. For e.g, there is no need for the Feature Extraction Process section, if you have used the default features.

2> For the Validation and Parameter tuning section, please mention the final values of the parameters used for training (if any). 


The final submissions have to be made on the 'Upload files' tab on the website before 11:59 pm on 14 March.
